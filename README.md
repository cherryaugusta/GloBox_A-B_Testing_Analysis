# GLOBOX FOOD AND DRINK BANNER EXPERIMENT: AN A/B TESTING ANALYSIS

GloBox, a hypothetical, renowned purveyor of exclusive fashion and luxury decor products, recently expanded its product offerings to include food and drink items, aiming to boost revenue in this category. To raise awareness, the company conducted an A/B test on its mobile website, introducing a food and drink banner to assess its impact on user conversions and spending. Users were randomly assigned to either a control group, which did not see the banner, or a treatment group, which did. The primary metric of interest was the conversion rate, defined as the percentage of users who made a purchase.

The study aimed to evaluate two main outcomes: the effect of the banner on conversion rates and average user spending, taking into account novelty effects and power analyses.
